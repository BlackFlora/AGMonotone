# Round & Split

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukhnos/roundandsplit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukhnos/roundandsplit)

I needed a tip calculator, so I wrote one.

I always round my tips, and when I dine out with a friend, I email them
reminders that I owe them money or vice versa. I was looking for a tip
calculator that could do both, but there wasn't any. Plus, most tip calculators
out there have a lot of features that I don't need.

So I decided to make one. Or two in fact – I've made an iOS version and an
Android version, because I happen to know programming on both platforms.

I've also made this an open source project. You are welcome to build the app
on your own from the source code.
